# Config
System/Application config scripts & preferences. Most of the MacOS tweaks using `defaults` come from [Mathias Byens' excellent list](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos)

Some of the tasks performed are:

- Install Homebrew, various packages & casks
- Set various system prefs
- Link some application settings to config files in [./configs](./configs)
- Configure GUI apps & System Preferences via AppleScript when necessary

## Prerequisites
- Terminal must have permission to make system changes (Add it to the list under System Preferences>Security & Privacy>Accessibility)
